# Tips Dataset Regression Analysis

This project explores the [Seaborn Tips dataset](https://github.com/mwaskom/seaborn-data) to understand tipping behavior in relation to total bills, group size, and other factors.

## Project Overview

- **EDA**: Histograms, box plots, scatter plots, count plots, and pair plots.
- **Simple Linear Regression**: Predict tip based on total bill.
- **Multiple Linear Regression**: Added group size, gender, day, time, and smoker status.
- **Ridge Regression**: Regularized model to reduce overfitting and improve generalization.

## Key Learnings

- Tips increase with total bill and party size.
- Saturday is the busiest day, mostly during dinner.
- Ridge regression slightly improves test performance over standard regression.

## Tools Used

- Python, pandas, seaborn, matplotlib, scikit-learn
